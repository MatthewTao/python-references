# Containerised Python

It can be easiest to have something to run in a container.
Nice and easy to manage dependencies and run things across different platforms.

## Podman vs Docker

Mostly interchangeable from what I can see for now.

- `podman-build` (Containerfile / Dockerfile) vs `docker build` (Dockerfile)
- `podman-compose` (and having to install it) vs `docker compose`
