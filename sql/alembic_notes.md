# Alembic Thoughts

Seems to be a way to manage changes to particular schema.
It will generate upgrade and downgrade steps for a given changeset.
This seems quite handy to seamlessly move between versions for an application
which might not want to be stopped.
I'm not sure how whether it will handle jumping multiple versions though.
That could be interesting to see.

## Samples

We would first generate a 'change set' by running the revision command,
along with various tags and descriptions.

``` shell
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "First Schema Creation"

alembic revision --autogenerate -m "add artist dob" 
```

This autogenerated change set may not contain all the right steps,
as it is just a best guess.
we can modify that to fit what we actually need.

After the change set is generated and confirmed, run the `alembic upgrade head` command.
This will action the change set.
